This is a silly collaborative clicking tool.

The web page has a canvas. When you click on it, every visitor on the web page sees your click.

To run on a real server, META-INF/config.properties must be modified to include the origin that clients see the server in.

To build, 
    gradle build
    
To run,
    gradle run
